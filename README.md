Developers

Testing
-------

Any changes should be run through the tests in the tests/ directory. These are not included in the general software releases, but can be accessed via Git in the usual manner. The unit tests use PHPUnit and there is also a Bug Scanner module which looks for simple mistakes like leaving print_r's in your code.
